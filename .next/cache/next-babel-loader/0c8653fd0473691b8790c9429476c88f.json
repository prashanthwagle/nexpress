The next morning, Harlan's housekeeper Fran finds him dead, with his throat slit. The police are convinced it was suicide, but an anonymous party pays private detective Benoit Blanc to investigate. Blanc learns that Harlan's relationships with his family were strained: he threatened to expose his son-in-law Richard for cheating on his wife Linda, cut off his daughter-in-law Joni's allowance for stealing from him, fired his younger son Walt from his publishing company, and had an altercation with his black sheep grandson Ransom. Unknown to Blanc, after the party, Harlan's nurse, Marta Cabrera, accidentally administered him an overdose of morphine instead of his usual medication, and then realized what she had done upon seeing the label on the medication vial. She could not find the antidote, leaving Harlan minutes to live. To protect Marta, Harlan gave her instructions to create a false alibi to avoid suspicion over his death; he then slit his own throat. Marta carried out Harlan's instructions; Harlan's elderly mother saw her doing so but mistook her for Ransom. Marta cannot lie without vomiting, so she gives true but incomplete answers when Blanc questions her. Blanc asks her to assist his investigation. As they search the property, Marta attempts to conceal evidence of her guilt. Harlan's will is read: he left everything to Marta, to her astonishment as well as the family's. They turn on her, but Ransom helps her escape. Ransom persuades Marta to confess to him and offers to help her in exchange for his share of the inheritance. The other Thrombeys try to persuade Marta to renounce her inheritance; Walt threatens to expose her mother as an undocumented immigrant. Marta receives an anonymous blackmail note with a partial photocopy of Harlan's toxicology report. She and Ransom drive to the medical examiner's office, but the building has been destroyed by arson. Marta receives an anonymous email with a time and address to meet the blackmailer. Blanc and the police, also investigating the arson, spot Marta and Ransom. After a brief car chase, the police arrest Ransom; Blanc explains to Marta that Harlan's mother saw Ransom climbing down from Harlan's room the night he died. Marta goes to the address in the email and discovers Fran drugged, along with her own missing medical case. Marta hesitates, realizing that Fran can link her to the crime, but performs CPR on Fran and calls 911. Marta confesses to Blanc, but Ransom has already informed on her. At the house, Marta finds a copy of the full toxicology report hidden in Fran's cannabis stash. Blanc reads it, and then interrupts Marta before she can confess to the family that she caused Harlan's death. Blanc reveals his deductions: After Ransom learned at the party that Harlan was leaving everything to Marta, he swapped the contents of Marta's medication vials and stole the antidote so she would kill Harlan with an overdose of morphine, making her ineligible to claim the inheritance by the slayer rule. However, Marta actually administered the correct medicine without reading the labels, recognizing it by the weight and viscosity of the fluid, and is therefore innocent of Harlan's death. After the death was reported as suicide, Ransom anonymously hired Blanc to expose Marta as a murderer. Fran later saw Ransom stealing Marta's medical case to hide the fact that the contents of the vials had been switched, and sent him the blackmail note. Realizing that Marta had unknowingly given Harlan the correct medication, Ransom forwarded the note to Marta. He burned down the medical examiner's office to destroy evidence of Marta's innocence. Finally, he drugged Fran with an overdose of morphine and emailed her location to Marta, planning to frame Marta for Fran's murder. Marta tricks Ransom into confessing by lying that Fran has survived and will implicate him; after he confesses and vows revenge, she vomits on him, revealing the lie. Enraged, he attacks her with a knife, but it is a retractable stage knife. The police have recorded Ransom's confession, and arrest him. Marta asks Blanc when he realized she played a part in Harlan's death, and Blanc responds that he knew from the beginning, noting a small spot of blood on one of Marta's shoes. As Ransom is taken into custody, Marta watches the Thrombeys depart from what is now her mansion.

The car chase scene goes through the Assabet Woolen Mill (pictured), now known as Mill & Main. Development Edit After making the 2005 film Brick, writer and director Rian Johnson came up with the basic concept for Knives Out.[8] In June 2010, he expressed interest in making an Agatha Christie-inspired murder mystery film. He told The Independent that he wanted to make the film after finishing Looper (2012).[9] However, Johnson's next film project became Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017).[10] Johnson spent seven months writing the script after finishing his press tour for Star Wars: The Last Jedi.[11] In developing the film, Johnson cited several classic mystery thrillers and mystery comedies as influences, including The Last of Sheila, Murder on the Orient Express, Something's Afoot, Murder by Death, Death on the Nile, The Private Eyes, The Mirror Crack'd, Evil Under the Sun, Deathtrap, Clue, and Gosford Park.[12] The 1972 version of Sleuth, a favorite \\\"whodunit adjacent\\\" of Johnson's, was also an inspiration, particularly for the setting and set design, including the automata, Jolly Jack the Sailor.[13][14][15] The title was taken from the 2001 Radiohead song \\\"Knives Out\\\"; Johnson, a Radiohead fan, said: \\\"Obviously, the movie has nothing to do with the song ... That turn of phrase has always stuck in my head. And it just seemed like a great title for a murder mystery.\\\"[16] The name Harlan Thrombey is taken from a 1981 Choose Your Own Adventure whodunit, Who Killed Harlowe Thrombey?[17] Knives Out was announced in September 2018, with Daniel Craig starring. It was sold to distributors during the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival.[18] In October 2018, Chris Evans, Lakeith Stanfield, Michael Shannon, Ana de Armas, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Toni Collette joined the cast.[19][20][21][22][23][24][25] In November 2018, Christopher Plummer, Jaeden Martell, Katherine Langford, Riki Lindhome, and Edi Patterson joined the cast.[26][27][28] Frequent Johnson collaborator Noah Segan was announced as being in the film in December.[29][30] In March 2019, Frank Oz, who previously worked with Johnson in The Last Jedi, revealed that he would be appearing in a small role.[31] M. Emmet Walsh was cast in the film to replace Ricky Jay, who had died during production.[32] Filming Edit Principal photography began on October 30, 2018, in Boston, Massachusetts and wrapped on December 20, 2018.[33][34][35] Filming locations included Easton, Marlborough, Natick, Wellesley, Maynard, Waltham, and Medfield, Massachusetts.[36][37][38][39][40] The exteriors of the house were filmed at a mansion located in Natick, about 17 miles west of Boston.[41] The Ames Mansion in Borderland State Park, Massachusetts, was used for many interior shots.[42][41] Music Edit Nathan Johnson composed the film score. He previously worked with director Rian Johnson, who is his cousin, on Brick, The Brothers Bloom, and Looper. The soundtrack was released on November 27, 2019, coinciding with the film's release, by Cut Narrative Records.[43] Release Edit Knives Out had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2019.[44] It was theatrically released on November 27, 2019, by Lionsgate.[45] Director Rian Johnson released an \\\"in-theater\\\" audio commentary for those watching the film a second time.[46] Home media Edit Knives Out was released on Digital HD on February 7, 2020 and on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K on February 25.[47] Reception Edit Box office Edit As of March 20, 2020, Knives Out has grossed $165.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $147.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $312.9 million.[5][6] Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $82 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.[48] In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside Queen & Slim, and was initially projected to gross $22\\u201325 million from 3,391 theaters over its five-day opening weekend.[49] The film held advance screenings on November 22 and 23, making $2 million from 936 theaters.[50] It then made $8.5 million (including the $2 million from the screenings and $1.7 million from Tuesday night previews) and $6.8 million on Thanksgiving Day, increasing estimates to $44 million. It went on to gross $27.2 million in its opening weekend (a five-day total of $41.7 million), finishing second behind Frozen II.[51] In its second and third weekends the film made $14.2 million and $9.3 million, remaining in second then finishing third.[52][53] The film made $6.5 million in its fourth weekend and then $9.7 million in its fifth (and a total of $16.6 million over the five-day Christmas frame).[54][55] Critical response Edit On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 420 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's critics' consensus reads: \\\"Knives Out sharpens old murder-mystery tropes with a keenly assembled suspense outing that makes brilliant use of writer-director Rian Johnson's stellar ensemble.\\\"[56] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 82 out of 100, based on reviews from 52 critics, indicating \\\"universal acclaim\\\".[57] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\\"A\\u2013\\\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an average 4.5 out of 5 stars, with 67% saying they would definitely recommend it.[51] David Rooney, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, described the film as an \\\"ingeniously plotted, tremendously entertaining and deviously irreverent crowd-pleaser\\\" and \\\"a treat from start to finish,\\\" praising the film's script, the throwbacks to the murder mysteries of the 1970s, and the actors' performances.[58] Dana Stevens of Slate wrote \\\"Knives Out knows exactly what kind of movie it is: a sendup of twisty murder mysteries with all-star ensemble casts that also loves and respects that silly tradition.\\\"[59] For The A.V. Club, A. A. Dowd called the film \\\"madly entertaining\\\" and \\\"an ingenious sleight-of-hand crowdpleaser\\\".[60] David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film an A\\u2212, writing \\\"Johnson has devised a murder-mystery that's eager to defy your expectations, but unwilling to betray your trust. The film may be more smart than stylish, and it may opt for a reasonable outcome over an overwhelmingly shocking one, but Knives Out doesn't let the element of surprise ruin a good story.\\\"[61] David Sims of The Atlantic wrote that Johnson \\\"turned the whodunit on its head\\\".[62] Dani di Placido of Forbes wrote that Johnson \\\"finds a way to revitalise the concept\\\" and \\\"makes murder mystery great again\\\".[63] It was chosen by the American Film Institute, the National Board of Review, and Time magazine[64] as one of the top ten films of 2019 in each respective list.[65] Director Edgar Wright also stated that Knives Out was his favorite film of the year and that it is \\\"fiendishly plotted\\\".[66] Political themes Edit Andrew R. Chow, writing for Time, described the film as \\\"one of the most unexpectedly subversive films of the year.\\\" Ram Bergman, the co-producer of Knives Out and Johnson\\u2019s longtime collaborator, says that the sociopolitical elements of the film were essential from its infancy. The Latina heroine of the movie, de Armas, saw the film as a major studio release that stars a Latina and condemns entrenched aspects of American society.[67] Carlos Aguilar, writing for Remezcla, said the Thrombey family had a \\\"racist worldview\\\", contrasted by the almost supernatural purity of the Latina heroine as \\\"From the flames of greed, de Armas\\u2019 Marta emerges as a heroine for all immigrants and their children whose most inalienable superpower comes from empathy, civility, resilience and the utmost value for human life. Kindness is exalted, not denigrated.\\\"[68] Graham Hillard, writing for National Review, states that the movie \\\"revels in the alleged moral superiority of the \\u201Coppressed\\u201D and dares its audience to object.\\\" He points out that, \\\"The question of who will possess a house becomes a metaphor for who will possess a nation.\\\" He says of the ending that, \\\"Anyone who doubts that Knives Out is, and means to be, a commentary on the future of race dynamics in this country need only examine the movie\\u2019s intensely political concluding shot, in which Harlan\\u2019s family is cast from the manse and left to dwell in the outer darkness.\\\"[69] Accolades Edit Award Date of ceremony Category Recipient(s) Result AACTA Awards[70] January 3, 2020 Best International Supporting Actress Toni Collette Nominated Academy Awards February 9, 2020 Best Original Screenplay Rian Johnson Nominated American Cinema Editors[71] January 17, 2020 Best Edited Feature Film \\u2013 Comedy or Musical Bob Ducsay Nominated American Film Institute[72] January 3, 2020 Top Ten Films of the Year Knives Out Won Art Directors Guild Awards[73] February 1, 2020 Best Contemporary Film David Crank Nominated British Academy Film Awards[74] February 2, 2020 Best Original Screenplay Rian Johnson Nominated Casting Society of America[75] January 30, 2020 Feature Big Budget \\u2013 Comedy Mary Vernieu, Angela Peri (Location Casting) and Brett Howe (Associate) Won Costume Designers Guild Awards[76] January 28, 2020 Excellence in Contemporary Film Jenny Eagan Won Critics' Choice Movie Awards January 12, 2020 Best Acting Ensemble Knives Out Nominated Best Original Screenplay Rian Johnson Nominated Best Comedy Knives Out Nominated Georgia Film Critics Association[77] January 10, 2020 Best Original Screenplay Rian Johnson Nominated Gold Derby Awards[78] February 4, 2020 Best Picture Knives Out Nominated Best Original Screenplay Rian Johnson Nominated Best Production Design David Crank and David Schlesinger Nominated Best Ensemble Knives Out Nominated Golden Globe Awards[79] January 5, 2020 Best Motion Picture \\u2013 Musical or Comedy Nominated Best Actor \\u2013 Musical or Comedy Daniel Craig Nominated Best Actress \\u2013 Musical or Comedy Ana de Armas Nominated Hollywood Critics Association Awards[80] January 9, 2020 Best Cast Knives Out Won Best Original Screenplay Rian Johnson Nominated National Board of Review[81] January 8, 2020 Top Ten Films Knives Out Won Best Ensemble Won Producers Guild of America Awards[82] January 18, 2020 Best Theatrical Motion Picture Nominated Satellite Awards[83] December 19, 2019 Best Motion Picture \\u2013 Musical or Comedy Nominated Best Actor \\u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy Daniel Craig Nominated Best Actress \\u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy Ana de Armas Nominated Best Cast \\u2013 Motion Picture Knives Out Won Writers Guild of America Awards[84] February 1, 2020 Best Original Screenplay Rian Johnson Nominated Sequel Edit Before the release of Knives Out, Johnson said he would like to create sequels with Benoit Blanc investigating further mysteries, and already had an idea for a new film.[85] In January 2020, Johnson confirmed that he was writing a sequel, intended to focus on Blanc investigating a new mystery. Craig is expected to reprise his role, and acknowledged interest in the project.[86] On February 6, 2020, Lionsgate announced that a sequel had been greenlit.[7] References Edit \\\"Nathan Johnson to Reteam with Rian Johnson on 'Knives Out'\\\".

The film received critical acclaim, particularly for its screenplay, direction, and acting, and grossed $312 million worldwide against a $40 million budget. At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, the film received three nominations in the Musical or Comedy category: Best Motion Picture, Best Actor for Craig, and Best Actress for de Armas. It also received Best Original Screenplay nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards and 92nd Academy Awards. It was also selected by the American Film Institute and the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2019.\r\n\r\nLionsgate announced in February 2020 that a sequel was in development.[7]\r\n\r\nContents\r\nPlot\tEdit\r\nWealthy crime novelist Harlan Thrombey invites his family to his Massachusetts mansion for his 85th birthday party. The next morning, Harlan's housekeeper Fran finds him dead, with his throat slit. The police are convinced it was suicide, but an anonymous party pays private detective Benoit Blanc to investigate.\r\n\r\nBlanc learns that Harlan's relationships with his family were strained: he threatened to expose his son-in-law Richard for cheating on his wife Linda, cut off his daughter-in-law Joni's allowance for stealing from him, fired his younger son Walt from his publishing company, and had an altercation with his black sheep grandson Ransom.\r\n\r\nUnknown to Blanc, after the party, Harlan's nurse, Marta Cabrera, accidentally administered him an overdose of morphine instead of his usual medication, and then realized what she had done upon seeing the label on the medication vial. She could not find the antidote, leaving Harlan minutes to live. To protect Marta, Harlan gave her instructions to create a false alibi to avoid suspicion over his death; he then slit his own throat. Marta carried out Harlan's instructions; Harlan's elderly mother saw her doing so but mistook her for Ransom.\r\n\r\nMarta cannot lie without vomiting, so she gives true but incomplete answers when Blanc questions her. Blanc asks her to assist his investigation. As they search the property, Marta attempts to conceal evidence of her guilt.\r\n\r\nHarlan's will is read: he left everything to Marta, to her astonishment as well as the family's. They turn on her, but Ransom helps her escape. Ransom persuades Marta to confess to him and offers to help her in exchange for his share of the inheritance. The other Thrombeys try to persuade Marta to renounce her inheritance; Walt threatens to expose her mother as an undocumented immigrant.\r\n\r\nMarta receives an anonymous blackmail note with a partial photocopy of Harlan's toxicology report. She and Ransom drive to the medical examiner's office, but the building has been destroyed by arson. Marta receives an anonymous email with a time and address to meet the blackmailer. Blanc and the police, also investigating the arson, spot Marta and Ransom. After a brief car chase, the police arrest Ransom; Blanc explains to Marta that Harlan's mother saw Ransom climbing down from Harlan's room the night he died.\r\n\r\nMarta goes to the address in the email and discovers Fran drugged, along with her own missing medical case. Marta hesitates, realizing that Fran can link her to the crime, but performs CPR on Fran and calls 911. Marta confesses to Blanc, but Ransom has already informed on her. At the house, Marta finds a copy of the full toxicology report hidden in Fran's cannabis stash. Blanc reads it, and then interrupts Marta before she can confess to the family that she caused Harlan's death.\r\n\r\nBlanc reveals his deductions: After Ransom learned at the party that Harlan was leaving everything to Marta, he swapped the contents of Marta's medication vials and stole the antidote so she would kill Harlan with an overdose of morphine, making her ineligible to claim the inheritance by the slayer rule. However, Marta actually administered the correct medicine without reading the labels, recognizing it by the weight and viscosity of the fluid, and is therefore innocent of Harlan's death. After the death was reported as suicide, Ransom anonymously hired Blanc to expose Marta as a murderer. Fran later saw Ransom stealing Marta's medical case to hide the fact that the contents of the vials had been switched, and sent him the blackmail note. Realizing that Marta had unknowingly given Harlan the correct medication, Ransom forwarded the note to Marta. He burned down the medical examiner's office to destroy evidence of Marta's innocence. Finally, he drugged Fran with an overdose of morphine and emailed her location to Marta, planning to frame Marta for Fran's murder.\r\n\r\nMarta tricks Ransom into confessing by lying that Fran has survived and will implicate him; after he confesses and vows revenge, she vomits on him, revealing the lie. Enraged, he attacks her with a knife, but it is a retractable stage knife. The police have recorded Ransom's confession, and arrest him. Marta asks Blanc when he realized she played a part in Harlan's death, and Blanc responds that he knew from the beginning, noting a small spot of blood on one of Marta's shoes. As Ransom is taken into custody, Marta watches the Thrombeys depart from what is now her mansion.\r\n\r\nCast\tEdit\r\nDaniel Craig as Benoit Blanc: A world-famous private detective\r\nChris Evans as Hugh Ransom Drysdale: Harlan's grandson (Linda and Richard's son), a spoiled playboy\r\nAna de Armas as Marta Cabrera: Harlan's nurse and close friend\r\nJamie Lee Curtis as Linda Drysdale: Harlan's eldest daughter, a real estate mogul\r\nMichael Shannon as Walter \"Walt\" Thrombey: Harlan's youngest son, Harlan's publishing company CEO\r\nDon Johnson as Richard Drysdale: Harlan's son-in-law (Linda's husband)\r\nToni Collette as Joni Thrombey: Harlan's daughter-in-law (widow of Neil), a lifestyle guru\r\nLakeith Stanfield as Detective Lieutenant Elliott: A local detective\r\nKatherine Langford as Megan \"Meg\" Thrombey: Harlan's granddaughter (Joni and Neil's daughter), a liberal student\r\nJaeden Martell as Jacob Thrombey: Harlan's grandson (Walt and Donna's son), an alt-right youth\r\nChristopher Plummer as Harlan Thrombey: A wealthy mystery novelist found dead after his 85th birthday party.

The car chase scene goes through the Assabet Woolen Mill (pictured), now known as Mill & Main.\r\nDevelopment\tEdit\r\nAfter making the 2005 film Brick, writer and director Rian Johnson came up with the basic concept for Knives Out.[8] In June 2010, he expressed interest in making an Agatha Christie-inspired murder mystery film. He told The Independent that he wanted to make the film after finishing Looper (2012).[9] However, Johnson's next film project became Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017).[10] Johnson spent seven months writing the script after finishing his press tour for Star Wars: The Last Jedi.[11]\r\n\r\nIn developing the film, Johnson cited several classic mystery thrillers and mystery comedies as influences, including The Last of Sheila, Murder on the Orient Express, Something's Afoot, Murder by Death, Death on the Nile, The Private Eyes, The Mirror Crack'd, Evil Under the Sun, Deathtrap, Clue, and Gosford Park.[12] The 1972 version of Sleuth, a favorite \"whodunit adjacent\" of Johnson's, was also an inspiration, particularly for the setting and set design, including the automata, Jolly Jack the Sailor.[13][14][15] The title was taken from the 2001 Radiohead song \"Knives Out\"; Johnson, a Radiohead fan, said: \"Obviously, the movie has nothing to do with the song ... That turn of phrase has always stuck in my head. And it just seemed like a great title for a murder mystery.\"[16] The name Harlan Thrombey is taken from a 1981 Choose Your Own Adventure whodunit, Who Killed Harlowe Thrombey?[17]\r\n\r\nKnives Out was announced in September 2018, with Daniel Craig starring. It was sold to distributors during the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival.[18] In October 2018, Chris Evans, Lakeith Stanfield, Michael Shannon, Ana de Armas, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Toni Collette joined the cast.[19][20][21][22][23][24][25] In November 2018, Christopher Plummer, Jaeden Martell, Katherine Langford, Riki Lindhome, and Edi Patterson joined the cast.[26][27][28] Frequent Johnson collaborator Noah Segan was announced as being in the film in December.[29][30] In March 2019, Frank Oz, who previously worked with Johnson in The Last Jedi, revealed that he would be appearing in a small role.[31] M. Emmet Walsh was cast in the film to replace Ricky Jay, who had died during production.[32]\r\n\r\nFilming\tEdit\r\nPrincipal photography began on October 30, 2018, in Boston, Massachusetts and wrapped on December 20, 2018.[33][34][35] Filming locations included Easton, Marlborough, Natick, Wellesley, Maynard, Waltham, and Medfield, Massachusetts.[36][37][38][39][40] The exteriors of the house were filmed at a mansion located in Natick, about 17 miles west of Boston.[41] The Ames Mansion in Borderland State Park, Massachusetts, was used for many interior shots.[42][41]\r\n\r\nMusic\tEdit\r\nNathan Johnson composed the film score. He previously worked with director Rian Johnson, who is his cousin, on Brick, The Brothers Bloom, and Looper. The soundtrack was released on November 27, 2019, coinciding with the film's release, by Cut Narrative Records.[43]\r\n\r\nRelease\tEdit\r\nKnives Out had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2019.[44] It was theatrically released on November 27, 2019, by Lionsgate.[45] Director Rian Johnson released an \"in-theater\" audio commentary for those watching the film a second time.[46]\r\n\r\nHome media\tEdit\r\nKnives Out was released on Digital HD on February 7, 2020 and on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K on February 25.[47]\r\n\r\nReception\tEdit\r\nBox office\tEdit\r\nAs of March 20, 2020, Knives Out has grossed $165.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $147.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $312.9 million.[5][6] Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $82 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.[48]\r\n\r\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside Queen & Slim, and was initially projected to gross $22–25 million from 3,391 theaters over its five-day opening weekend.[49] The film held advance screenings on November 22 and 23, making $2 million from 936 theaters.[50] It then made $8.5 million (including the $2 million from the screenings and $1.7 million from Tuesday night previews) and $6.8 million on Thanksgiving Day, increasing estimates to $44 million. It went on to gross $27.2 million in its opening weekend (a five-day total of $41.7 million), finishing second behind Frozen II.[51] In its second and third weekends the film made $14.2 million and $9.3 million, remaining in second then finishing third.[52][53] The film made $6.5 million in its fourth weekend and then $9.7 million in its fifth (and a total of $16.6 million over the five-day Christmas frame).[54][55]\r\n\r\nCritical response\tEdit\r\nOn the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 420 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's critics' consensus reads: \"Knives Out sharpens old murder-mystery tropes with a keenly assembled suspense outing that makes brilliant use of writer-director Rian Johnson's stellar ensemble.\"[56] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 82 out of 100, based on reviews from 52 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[57] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an average 4.5 out of 5 stars, with 67% saying they would definitely recommend it.[51]\r\n\r\nDavid Rooney, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, described the film as an \"ingeniously plotted, tremendously entertaining and deviously irreverent crowd-pleaser\" and \"a treat from start to finish,\" praising the film's script, the throwbacks to the murder mysteries of the 1970s, and the actors' performances.[58] Dana Stevens of Slate wrote \"Knives Out knows exactly what kind of movie it is: a sendup of twisty murder mysteries with all-star ensemble casts that also loves and respects that silly tradition.\"[59] For The A.V. Club, A. A. Dowd called the film \"madly entertaining\" and \"an ingenious sleight-of-hand crowdpleaser\".[60] David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film an A−, writing \"Johnson has devised a murder-mystery that's eager to defy your expectations, but unwilling to betray your trust. The film may be more smart than stylish, and it may opt for a reasonable outcome over an overwhelmingly shocking one, but Knives Out doesn't let the element of surprise ruin a good story.\"[61] David Sims of The Atlantic wrote that Johnson \"turned the whodunit on its head\".[62] Dani di Placido of Forbes wrote that Johnson \"finds a way to revitalise the concept\" and \"makes murder mystery great again\".[63]\r\n\r\nIt was chosen by the American Film Institute, the National Board of Review, and Time magazine[64] as one of the top ten films of 2019 in each respective list.[65] Director Edgar Wright also stated that Knives Out was his favorite film of the year and that it is \"fiendishly plotted\".[66]\r\n\r\nPolitical themes\tEdit\r\nAndrew R. Chow, writing for Time, described the film as \"one of the most unexpectedly subversive films of the year.\" Ram Bergman, the co-producer of Knives Out and Johnson’s longtime collaborator, says that the sociopolitical elements of the film were essential from its infancy. The Latina heroine of the movie, de Armas, saw the film as a major studio release that stars a Latina and condemns entrenched aspects of American society.[67] Carlos Aguilar, writing for Remezcla, said the Thrombey family had a \"racist worldview\", contrasted by the almost supernatural purity of the Latina heroine as \"From the flames of greed, de Armas’ Marta emerges as a heroine for all immigrants and their children whose most inalienable superpower comes from empathy, civility, resilience and the utmost value for human life. Kindness is exalted, not denigrated.\"[68] Graham Hillard, writing for National Review, states that the movie \"revels in the alleged moral superiority of the “oppressed” and dares its audience to object.\" He points out that, \"The question of who will possess a house becomes a metaphor for who will possess a nation.\" He says of the ending that, \"Anyone who doubts that Knives Out is, and means to be, a commentary on the future of race dynamics in this country need only examine the movie’s intensely political concluding shot, in which Harlan’s family is cast from the manse and left to dwell in the outer darkness.\"[69]\r\n\r\nAccolades\tEdit\r\nAward\tDate of ceremony\tCategory\tRecipient(s)\tResult\r\nAACTA Awards[70]\tJanuary 3, 2020\tBest International Supporting Actress\tToni Collette\tNominated\r\nAcademy Awards\tFebruary 9, 2020\tBest Original Screenplay\tRian Johnson\tNominated\r\nAmerican Cinema Editors[71]\tJanuary 17, 2020\tBest Edited Feature Film – Comedy or Musical\tBob Ducsay\tNominated\r\nAmerican Film Institute[72]\tJanuary 3, 2020\tTop Ten Films of the Year\tKnives Out\tWon\r\nArt Directors Guild Awards[73]\tFebruary 1, 2020\tBest Contemporary Film\tDavid Crank\tNominated\r\nBritish Academy Film Awards[74]\tFebruary 2, 2020\tBest Original Screenplay\tRian Johnson\tNominated\r\nCasting Society of America[75]\tJanuary 30, 2020\tFeature Big Budget – Comedy\tMary Vernieu, Angela Peri (Location Casting) and Brett Howe (Associate)\tWon\r\nCostume Designers Guild Awards[76]\tJanuary 28, 2020\tExcellence in Contemporary Film\tJenny Eagan\tWon\r\nCritics' Choice Movie Awards\tJanuary 12, 2020\tBest Acting Ensemble\tKnives Out\tNominated\r\nBest Original Screenplay\tRian Johnson\tNominated\r\nBest Comedy\tKnives Out\tNominated\r\nGeorgia Film Critics Association[77]\tJanuary 10, 2020\tBest Original Screenplay\tRian Johnson\tNominated\r\nGold Derby Awards[78]\tFebruary 4, 2020\tBest Picture\tKnives Out\tNominated\r\nBest Original Screenplay\tRian Johnson\tNominated\r\nBest Production Design\tDavid Crank and David Schlesinger\tNominated\r\nBest Ensemble\tKnives Out\tNominated\r\nGolden Globe Awards[79]\tJanuary 5, 2020\tBest Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\tNominated\r\nBest Actor – Musical or Comedy\tDaniel Craig\tNominated\r\nBest Actress – Musical or Comedy\tAna de Armas\tNominated\r\nHollywood Critics Association Awards[80]\tJanuary 9, 2020\tBest Cast\tKnives Out\tWon\r\nBest Original Screenplay\tRian Johnson\tNominated\r\nNational Board of Review[81]\tJanuary 8, 2020\tTop Ten Films\tKnives Out\tWon\r\nBest Ensemble\tWon\r\nProducers Guild of America Awards[82]\tJanuary 18, 2020\tBest Theatrical Motion Picture\tNominated\r\nSatellite Awards[83]\tDecember 19, 2019\tBest Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\tNominated\r\nBest Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy\tDaniel Craig\tNominated\r\nBest Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy\tAna de Armas\tNominated\r\nBest Cast – Motion Picture\tKnives Out\tWon\r\nWriters Guild of America Awards[84]\tFebruary 1, 2020\tBest Original Screenplay\tRian Johnson\tNominated\r\nSequel\tEdit\r\nBefore the release of Knives Out, Johnson said he would like to create sequels with Benoit Blanc investigating further mysteries, and already had an idea for a new film.[85] In January 2020, Johnson confirmed that he was writing a sequel, intended to focus on Blanc investigating a new mystery. Craig is expected to reprise his role, and acknowledged interest in the project.[86] On February 6, 2020, Lionsgate announced that a sequel had been greenlit.[7]\r\n\r\nReferences\tEdit\r\n \"Nathan Johnson to Reteam with Rian Johnson on 'Knives Out'\".
